# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic arcade-style game where you control a snake to eat food and grow in length. Avoid running into walls or your own tail!

## How to Play

2. The snake will move continuously in the direction it is facing.
3. Eat the food (green dot) to grow longer.
4. Avoid running into walls or the snake's own tail, as this will end the game.

## Features
